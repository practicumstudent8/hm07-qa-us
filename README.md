# Sprint 7 project
The project is about the testing the next APIs where I have used the various end points. 
The technologies that I have used in this project are javascript, Node.js, Postman, Vscode, git, github, swagger.
I perform two task for each of the requests. The requests are get, post, put and delete.
Each of the requests should have two response which are response status and actual response body.

Get: /api/v1/cards
Post: /api/v1/warehouses/check
Put: /api/v1/kits/3
Delete: /api/v1/kits/4

Put:  npx jest putHandlers.test.js
Delete:  npx jest deletHandlers.test.js
